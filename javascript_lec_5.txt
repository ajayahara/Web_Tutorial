//Different Types Of Conditional Statement
    There are mainly three types of conditional statement in Javascript.
    1.if Statement;

1.if Statement:-
    It is to specify a block of code to be executed if the condition us true.
    Syntax:-if(condition){  <------
        statement block            |
        ...............            |----->Block
        ...............            |

    a.if statement with boolean value:-
        Ex-1:-
            console.log("Code Start");
            if(true){
                console.log("Inside The Code");
            }
            console.log("Code End");
            Output:-
                "Code Start"
                "Inside The Code"
                "Code End " 
        Ex-2:-
            console.log("Code Start");
            if(false){
                console.log("Inside The Code");
            }
            console.log("Code End");
            Output:-
                "Code Start"
                "Code End "  
    b.if statement with a condition:-
        Ex-1:-
            if(5>3){
                console.log("Inside The Code");
            } 
            Output:-
                "Inside The Code"
            Explanation:Since 5>3 return true the code inside the block will be executed.
        Ex-2:-
            if(5>6){
                console.log("Inside The Code");
            } 
            Output:-
